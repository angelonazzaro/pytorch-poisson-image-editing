# Poisson Image Editing in Pytorch

Implemented using Green Function Convolution, as described in [Fast and Optimal Laplacian Solver for Gradient-Domain Image Editing using Green Function Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00176)

Things to include in interface:
 - blending mode (source or mixed)
 - derivative type?
 - padding mode?
